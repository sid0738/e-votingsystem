I have done this project helping fellow students who were having final project at their college when i was also a third year student at Institute Of Finance Management-IFM. This is very simple and easy to use project which need you just to import the database(poll.sql) and php files on your web server then ready to go.

The project is an open source licenced, you can edit the codes, modify and distribute as you wish. Its a free project to show my contribution to the open source society.
